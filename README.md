**Toronto Airbnb Dataset Analysis**

**Medium Blog Post**

Here is the Medium blog post I have written: https://le-peter1993.medium.com/data-exploration-for-toronto-airbnb-56b5387d7007

**Libraries Used:**

I use Python3 in my Jupyter Notebook:

1. Numpy 
2. Pandas 
3. Scikit Learn 
4. Matplotlib 
5. Seaborn
6. Folium
7. Collections
8. Math


**The Motivation for the Project**

This project (Write a Data Science Blog Post) is part of Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program.
I used Toronto Airbnb Dataset for this project as its the city I live in. I'm interested in using data science techniques to analyze ways to improve future listings.
The questions that will be analyzed may be similar to data sources one might encounter in a business setting.
Additionally, many of the approaches and skills I used in this project can be applicable to future work projects. 


Using the data, I answered the following questions:

1. What are the most common amenities in the dataset?
2. Which neighborhoods have the highest number of listings and rating review scores?
3. What is the relationship between the type of room and price listing?
4. What are the most influential features of the dataset to predict the price of a listing?

The dataset describes the listing activities. The original dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/robinkongninglo/toronto-airbnb-dataset
