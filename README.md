The Motivation for the Project
This project (Write a Data Science Blog Post) is part of Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program.
I used Toronto Airbnb Dataset for this project as its the city I live in. I'm interested in using data science techniques to analyze ways to improve future listings.
The questions that will be analyze are may be similar to data sources one might see in a business setting.
Additionally, many of the approaches I used in this project can be applicable to my present and future work projects. 

Using the data, I answered the following questions:

1. What are the most common amenities in the dataset?
2. Which neighborhoods have the highest number of listings and rating review scores?
3. What is the relationship between the type of room and price listing?
4. What are the most influential features of the dataset to predict the price of a listing?
I used Seattle Airbnb Dataset for this project. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, 
the dataset describes the listing activities of homestays in Seattle, WA. The orijinal dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle
